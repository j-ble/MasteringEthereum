# Mastering Ethereum 🚀

A guided, hands-on journey through *Cyfrin Updraft* & *Mastering Ethereum* by Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood — implemented by [Jacob Blemaster](https://github.com/j-ble).

## Before Starting
- Keep in mind to run the contracts on the zkSync Sepolia Testnet, move the contracts that you want to run into the folder named './contracts'.

## 📘 About

This repository contains practical implementations and experiments based on the **Mastering Ethereum** book. It is designed to reinforce key concepts in Ethereum development, including:

- Ethereum architecture and accounts
